<h1>About Philosobot</h1>

<p><strong>Philosobot</strong> is an AI-powered chatbot with a philosophical twist. Built using Blazor Server and OpenAI's GPT API, it responds to your questions with thoughtful, nuanced language — shaped by distinct philosophical personas ranging from analytic logic to poetic postcolonial critique.</p>

<h2>Why Philosobot?</h2>
<p>This project started as an exploration: what if a chatbot didn’t just give answers — what if it had a <em>voice</em>? A tone? A perspective? Philosobot demonstrates how prompt engineering and UI design can create AI interactions that feel like real intellectual dialogue, not just Q&A.</p>

<h2>A Note on Intent</h2>

<p>Philosobot isn’t meant to replace professional philosophers or academic discourse. Rather, it offers a space for reflective thinking and human-centered dialogue — especially at a time when so many tools prioritize efficiency over meaning. It’s a small experiment in bringing voice, depth, and care back into our interactions with technology.</p>

<h2>How It Works</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Tech Stack:</strong> Blazor Server (.NET 7), OpenAI GPT API, secure system prompt injection</li>
    <li><strong>Personas:</strong> Predefined tones shaped via system prompts and selected via dropdown</li>
    <li><strong>UI:</strong> Minimalist, accessible design with custom branding and a philosophy-themed logo</li>
</ul>

<h2>About the Developer</h2>
<p>Created by <strong>Joel Southall</strong> — software developer, philosopher, and storyteller. Joel's background bridges programming and the humanities, with interests in AI, pedagogy, and Indigenous knowledge systems. Philosobot reflects that intersection.</p>
